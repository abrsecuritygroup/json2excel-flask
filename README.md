# json2excel-flask
This project is in its infancy and functions as a tool to simply upload a JSON file, export the data to an excel file, and make the file available for download. We use this tool mainly for "Breach Data", but it can be customized to fit any data needs. For now, this app should only be hosted locally unless you are using a production WSGI server which will be our next step.
